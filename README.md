# SNAKE-USING-PY
created a small python based game using packages within python.
The initial idea of the game was to get well versed with python and to implement something in less amount of time.
I came across the code on a youtube channel called "engineering man".
I am presently trying to make the code more concise and hopefully a better version of the same code.
In non conda users I highly recommend installing "curses" package in your python
The python version on which I created is 2.7.x
